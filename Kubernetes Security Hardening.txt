Kubernetes Security Hardening

Scanning of containers and pods for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations: Check this
Implement the least privilege principle: Confirm this
Network separation/firewalls: Check this
Strong authentication: How to____
Log auditing: Confirm this





When discussing CIS benchmarking for Kubernetes hardening, a cybersecurity expert should consider several key factors: 
 1. Compliance: Ensuring that the Kubernetes environment meets the relevant security standards and regulations, such as the CIS Benchmarks for Kubernetes.

 2. Network security: Implementing secure network policies, such as restricting access to the Kubernetes API and enabling encryption for communication between nodes.

 3. Container security: Ensuring that containers are properly configured and isolated, and that they do not contain vulnerabilities or malicious code.

 4. Pod security: Implementing security policies for pods, such as restricting the use of privileged containers and limiting the capabilities of containers. 

5. Node security: Securing the underlying infrastructure, such as the host operating system and hardware, to prevent attacks on the Kubernetes nodes. 

6. Identity and access management: Implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and services can access the Kubernetes environment. 

7. Monitoring and logging: Setting up monitoring and logging systems to detect and respond to security incidents, and to maintain an audit trail of all activities in the Kubernetes environment. 

8. Continuous monitoring: Regularly reviewing and updating the security policies and configurations to ensure that they remain effective and up-to-date with the latest threats and vulnerabilities.

 9. Incident response: Having a well-defined incident response plan in place to quickly and effectively respond to security incidents, and to minimize the impact of any potential breaches. 10. Training and education: Providing regular training and education to the Kubernetes users and administrators to ensure that they are aware of the latest security threats and best practices.

# Cases - based on the numbers and the repo names + business criticality
# Get the tags for the projects(s) and consider it in the rule engine
