The goal of the JSON object is to make it visible to developers in their pipelines without clicking on the security pipeline link.
Change the security template yaml file by removing the allow-failure or setting to false in a forked repo
Modify a dev project and call the forked sec template file.
Create a test branch on the sec pipeline and change severity score to 2 instead of 3 AND ensure the app-name=“<a-specific-dev-project>” 
Confirm the dev pipeline fails even without a dependency (only* needs keywords) change

MAIN hard-block
(1) Setup the backend : nginx , uswgi,  SSL, and CI/CD SETUP
Add the CURL request to clean.sh (confirm this always works via an echo stmt)
Confirm the API responds by printing the JSON response.
(2)
**** Add the CURL request to the sec template in a forked repo
Call the sec template in a specific dev project
Check if the response from the server is being processed.

Improvement
Setup a mail server on EC2
Send a mail to security@payconiq.com IF there is a severe vulnerability 




#### SERVER ADMIN

For Kubernetes pods to receive API responses from external APIs,  use the Kubernetes service abstraction to expose your application running in a pod to external services. Typically, this is done using either a NodePort, LoadBalancer, or an Ingress resource. Once exposed, your Kubernetes pod can make HTTP/HTTPS requests to external APIs and receive their responses.
