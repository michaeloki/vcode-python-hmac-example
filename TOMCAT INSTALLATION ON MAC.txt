To install a corresponding JRE for Corretto JDK 19.0.2, you can download the Corretto JRE from the official Amazon Corretto website.

Here are the steps:
Go to the Corretto download page (Note: I am not allowed to add links)
Click on the "Download" button for the Corretto JRE package corresponding to your operating system (MacOS in your case).
Choose the version 19.0.2 and click on the download link.
Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the prompts to install the Corretto JRE.
The Corretto JRE should be installed in a directory such as /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/corretto-19/ (this may vary depending on your system configuration).
